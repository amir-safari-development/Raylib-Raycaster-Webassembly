          <h3>Understanding Raycasting Logic</h3>
          <p>
            Our engine transforms a simple 2D grid map into a 3D perspective by casting rays from the player's position.
            For every vertical column on the screen, a ray is fired. We calculate the distance to the nearest wall using
            trigonometry and the DDA algorithm. This distance determines the height of the wall slice drawn on the
            screen, creating the illusion of depth.

          <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            The most significant bug encountered during development was the "Fisheye Effect," where walls looked
            distorted at the edges of the screen. This occurred because rays at the edge of the FOV traveled longer
            distances than center rays. We solved this by multiplying the distance by the cosine of the angle difference
            between the ray and the player's viewing direction.
